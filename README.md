It's necessary to use the node environment to run it.
preferable to use in dev mode since there are no backend enabled.

## Init

have npm or yarn installed
to install everythin run
`yarn` or `npm install`

after everything is downloaded.

run `yarn start` or `npm run start` to initialize the development mode.
> note: CSS Can flick a little in this mode, but it only happens here.

### Fake backend.
there's a fake backend output that does a second field validation for more security.


## Build it.

To build simply run:

`yarn build` or `npm run build` and the output code will be at `/dist` folder.
